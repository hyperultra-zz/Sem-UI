Sem UI is [Semantic UI](http://www.semantic-ui.com), but regularly maintained by the community into the future.

The goal is to stay up-to-date with Semantic as changes and features are released, while also integrating community PRs regularly.

Semantic allows developers to build beautiful websites fast, with **concise HTML**, **intuitive javascript**, and **simplified debugging**, helping make front-end development a delightful experience.

## 2.4.2-onyx.1

Sem UI `2.4.2-onyx.1` includes fixes for NPM warnings and bumps Gulp to v4.

## Install
### Install using Yarn

```bash
yarn add sem-ui
```

### Changes to the interactive installer
The interactive installer no longer runs immediately after install. This caused issues for Yarn users and some CI setups. Instead, run `npm setup` or `gulp install` manually.
